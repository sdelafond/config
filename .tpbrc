### MIXER SETTINGS

## MIXER
# Use OSS mixer to change volume and for mute/unmute. This should be use on
# models with no hardware mixer (volume and mute buttons show no effect). R31
# is reported to have no hardware mixer. To use this you must enable write
# access to the NVRAM device (possibly dangerous). Possible values are on and
# off. Default is off.
#
#MIXER      ON

## MIXERSTEPS
# Defines how much steps should be available when using the OSS mixer. Default
# is 14. If an other number of steps is used, tpb needs write access to the
# nvram device.

#
#MIXERDEVICE /dev/mixer

# disconnected messages. Default is off.

# off. Default is auto.
